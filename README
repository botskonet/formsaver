Formsaver is a firefox extension that attempts to store the exact state of a web form in a firefox
bookmark. 


KNOWN ISSUES

- Sometimes, form fields with invalid name attributes, no id attributes, etc, will not fill in properly.
- There are some drawbacks to storing the form-fill javascript in the bookmarks:

   - Limited scope. I do not have access to some much-needed API calls within firefox, like detecting page load
     if you're redirected to the proper URL.
   - This makes it more difficult to re-load the field values, interact with the page events, etc.
